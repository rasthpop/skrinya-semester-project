## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.11+)
- PostgreSQL database

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

> By default, backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Database

- Set up a PostgreSQL database.
- Configure your `.env` file in both `backend/` and `frontend/` for DB connection strings and API URLs.

Example `.env` for backend:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/skrinya_db
```

### 4. Prisma (if needed)

```bash
cd frontend
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## Development Notes

- **Routing**: Frontend uses Next.js App Router (`/app`) structure.
- **Backend CORS** is configured to allow connections from the frontend.
- **APIs**: Campaigns, donations, and users are managed through RESTful FastAPI endpoints.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS is used for fast, responsive UI development.
